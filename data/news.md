## «Stay Home Learn TEI Publisher From Scratch» Online Course

A 3-part online course: 8th, 15th and 22nd of June 4-5 pm (CEST)

More than 30 people expressed interest in the course, which would
normally exceed our capacity. However, we decided to not reject anyone,
but rather adjust the format to be able to handle the larger group. We
would thus like to point out that

* the course will mainly target beginners who wish to publish TEI
documents and create a simple website for their edition. More advanced
topics like in depth coverage of TEI Publisher 6, web components, layout
and styling questions will be covered in a follow up event two weeks
later (to be announced)
* each week will start with a more lecture-like online session with Q&A
afterwards
* the online session will be recorded and made available on youtube for
later viewing
* there will be weekly assignments for the attendants to get some
hands-on experience
* participants are strongly encouraged to join a participants-only room
(to be announced) on the e-editiones [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/e-editiones/shared_invite/zt-e19jc03q-OFaVni~_lh6emSHen6pswg) for asking questions, but also to help others with the assignments. We hope to have a lively discussion there and would love to see participants support each other.
* please note that we only have a few tutors, so we cannot answer
questions or help troubleshooting issues beyond the immediate scope of
the course

Basic knowlegde of TEI is a prerequisite
